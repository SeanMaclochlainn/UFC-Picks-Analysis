# UFC-Picks-Analysis
An application the scrapes UFC fight picks from websites such as http://www.bloodyelbow.com or http://mmajunkie.com, and compares these with the actual results and betting odds, scraped from Wikipedia and www.bestfightodds.com. 

There is also a reconciliation feature, for cases where human intervention is needed to match the pick 

Finding pages for each event is done by using google search operators, e.g. 

site:bloodyelbow.com ufc 196 intitle:staff picks
